		<h4>Read your split ticket:</h4>
		<p>The <strong>left column shows the order</strong> you punched the controls for your course. It shows both the order (1, 2, 3) and the control code (108, 111, 132).</p>
		<p>The <strong>middle column shows your split time</strong>, the time you took to navigate from the previous control to this one.</p>
		<p>The <strong>right column shows your total time</strong>, since you punched the start box.<p>
		<p>If you see ----- or blank space, you may have missed a punch. Remember to go in order, and be sure the control unit beeps and flashes! If you realize you've skipped a control while you're on the course, you can go back to it, but you must "start over" from that point on the course (can't skip forward).</p>
		<p>If you see a lot of mistakes, it's possible the finish computer thought you were on a different course. Return to the finish tent to resolve the issue.</p>
